    "This dataset describes several physical and chemical qualities of various wines (both white and red) from Portugal [1]. These characteristics, such as pH, citric acid, alcohol content, and residual sugar, were tested by physicochemical machines by the CVRVV, the official wine testing entity of the region of Portugal which these wines were made. The output was determined by a minimum of three human judges, who judged the wine quality on a scale of 0-10 (0 being bad and 10 being excellent). "

    "We are to predict the rating of a wine, given its qualities, on a scale of one to ten. Third-party entities, such as winemakers and related businesses, are interested in these results so that they can determine what chemically constitutes a wine that will rank high. Then, wine can be manufactured that focuses on this attribute (or less on this attribute if there is a strong negative correlation between the rankin and a certain attribute). This high ranking can be used to market those wines, bringing in profits for the company."

    "### Once you begin modeling, how well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful to these third parties?\n",
    "Wine is often viewed as a very subjective experience. Wine chemical composition varies from year to year depending on the overall climate of the growing season. Given that quality is extremely subjective and variable, there is not a strong need for an extremely precise algorithm. With these considerations, a 60-70% accuracy will be deemed acceptable."
