    "This dataset describes several physical and chemical qualities of various wines (both white and red) from Portugal [1]. These characteristics, such as pH, citric acid, alcohol content, and residual sugar, were tested by physicochemical machines by the CVRVV, the official wine testing entity of the region of Portugal which these wines were made. The output was determined by a minimum of three human judges, who judged the wine quality on a scale of 0-10 (0 being bad and 10 being excellent). "
